      <p>PaaS is ideal for government designers looking to host prototypes online.</p>
      <p>It uses the command line to log in and publish, but we have seen that this quickly becomes second nature. Designers forget about the terminal window and appreciate the many other advantages of PaaS:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="list-bullet">It's easy to deploy your prototype straight from your machine. You don't have to learn git first.</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">It's quick to link PaaS and GitHub once you need to start collaborating</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">You can publish multiple versions of the same prototype really easily</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">The GOV.UK prototyping kit is &quot;Paas-Ready&quot; - you don't have to worry about infrastructure</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">It's easy to add a username and password (BasicAuth) to your prototypes so the public can't find them</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">Prototypes are normally always running - no waiting for Heroku to spin up*</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">A free trial account for 3 months with 1GB memory quota will be enough for many Alphas and several prototypes</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">It's easy to turn off prototypes you no longer need</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">It's run by government and is already accredited to Official, so it's safer to use than Heroku</li>
        <li class="list-bullet">It can grow with your team and service - your free account comes with up to 3 postgres databases on our 'free' plan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>* If a paying live service urgently needs capacity and is scaling faster than our infrastructure provider can roll out, we may steal free resources temporarily.</p>
