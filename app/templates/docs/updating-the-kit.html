<h2 id="updating">Updating</h2>
<p><strong>Important note</strong></p>
<p>If you have made any changes outside the <code>app</code> folder, this process will destroy those changes. We will try and improve the update process to avoid this, but in the meantime you will need to make a note of your changes outside <code>app</code>, and add them back after updating.</p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p>Download the latest prototype kit zip file from GitHub</p>
<p>In your project, delete everything apart from the <code>app</code> and <code>.git</code> folder</p>
<p>Copy everything from the latest kit to your project, apart from the <code>app</code> folder</p>

<h2 id="updating-via-the-command-line-advanced-">Updating via the command line (Advanced)</h2>
<p>If you have experience with the command line and your prototype is running within a git source repository then you can choose to update the kit with a series of commands.</p>
<p>Updating via the command line involves fetching the latest code from the &#39;upstream&#39; remote repository and then merging it into the git branch that contains your version of the prototyping kit. Below are the steps for doing that in detail.</p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<h4 id="view-git-remote-s-">View git remote(s)</h4>
<p>Firstly change to the base directory of your prototyping kit in terminal, for example:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/sites/govuk_prototype_kit
</code></pre><p>Once in the directory start by listing the git remote(s) you have referenced from your machine. To do this you type:</p>
<p> <code>git remote -v</code> and hit enter</p>
<p>This will typically output a list of all the remote git repositories that have the prototype code, for example:</p>
<pre><code>origin  https://github.com/paulmsmith/govuk_prototype_kit.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/paulmsmith/govuk_prototype_kit.git (push)
</code></pre><p>So long as you can see a list of repositories as above, we can move on to adding a reference to the original &#39;alphagov&#39; repository which we will need in order to update.</p>
<h4 id="adding-the-upstream-remote-repository">Adding the upstream remote repository</h4>
<p>To add the alphagov remote repository, type the following command and hit enter:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit.git
</code></pre><p>All being well, you will just return to a command prompt, now if you type:
<code>git remote -v</code></p>
<p>You should see an &#39;upstream&#39; in your list, for example:</p>
<pre><code>origin    https://github.com/paulmsmith/govuk_prototype_kit.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/paulmsmith/govuk_prototype_kit.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit.git (push)
</code></pre><h4 id="merging-from-upstream">Merging from upstream</h4>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve added the upstream remote, you can merge the latest code into yours with the following commands.</p>
<p>First you will &#39;fetch&#39; the latest code from the upstream latest-release branch. Type the following command and wait a few seconds.</p>
<pre><code>git fetch upstream latest-release
</code></pre><p>You will see it output a few lines telling you that was successful, for example:</p>
<pre><code>From https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit
 * branch            latest-release    -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
</code></pre><p>Next, we will merge the branch we just &#39;fetched&#39; into our master branch (note: you can substitute &#39;master&#39; for the branch you want to merge into if different)</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master &amp;&amp; git merge FETCH_HEAD
</code></pre><p>You shouldn&#39;t have any merge conflicts if you&#39;ve not changed files outside of the &#39;app&#39; folder. If you do, there are plenty of ways to fix the conflicts and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/">github has instructions</a> that should be easy to follow if you need a refresher course.</p>
<p>Check that the application starts. In terminal or command prompt type:</p>
<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre><p>After the kit has started, you should see a message telling you that the kit is running:</p>
<pre><code>Listening on port 3000 url: http://localhost:3000
</code></pre><p>If you see an error after updating, you may need to download extra code used by the kit before it can run.</p>
<p>You can get this by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre><p>The install may take up to a minute. Whilst installing it may WARN about some items - this is ok. As long as there are no ERRORs you can continue.</p>
<p>In terminal:</p>
<pre><code>npm start
</code></pre><p>If you still have an error, you can <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/issues">raise an issue within github</a> or ask in the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/prototype-kit/">Slack channel for users of the prototype kit</a> by providing as much information as you can about the error and the computer you are attempting to run the prototyping kit on.</p>

<h2 id="converting-old-prototypes">Converting old prototypes</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of the prototype kit used a different templating language called Mustache.</p>
<p>Converting Mustache templates to Nunjucks ones is relatively simple. Here are the main things you&#39;ll need to do:</p>
<h3 id="template-inheritance">Template inheritance</h3>
<pre><code>{{&lt;layout}}

{{/layout}}
</code></pre><p>Becomes…</p>
<pre><code>{% extends &quot;layout.html&quot; %}

<pre><code>{{$pageTitle}}

{{/pageTitle}}

<pre><code>{% block page_title %}
