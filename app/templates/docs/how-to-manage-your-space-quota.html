      <h1>How to manage your space quota</h1>

      <p>Your trial PaaS account comes with a limited amount of space for your prototypes. There are things you can do to limit the amount of space you are using.</p>

      <h2>Free up space</h2>
      <p>It is worth checking to see if you have any prototypes running that are no longer needed.</p>
      <p>To see all the apps you have running in your space run:</p>
      <pre>
<code>cf apps
</code>
</pre>
      <p>To stop an app run:</p>
      <pre>
<code>cf stop [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP]
</code>
</pre>
      <p>This will stop your app running but it will still have an active URL (“route” in Cloud Foundry speak) and count against your quota.</p>

      <p>To completely remove an app and any active routes run:</p>
      <pre><code>cf delete -r</code></pre>

      <p>Running <code>cf apps</code> again will allow you to check it has been removed.</p>

      <h2>Configure your deployment</h2>

      <p>By default each app will use 1G of memory. Lots of prototypes don't need as much memory as that but it will still count against your quota.<p> <p>You can use a <code>manifest.yml</code> file to reduce the amount of memory an app uses.<p>

      <p>Do this by including a <code>manifest.yml</code> file in the home directory of your prototype. The file should look similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>---
applications:
- name: [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP]
  memory: 128M
</code></pre>

      <p>The memory attribute requires a unit of measurement: M, MB, G, or GB, in upper case or lower case.</p>

      <p>The manifest.yml file can also be used to reduce the complexity of your push command or add extra instances for resilience. There is more <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html">information on using manifest.yml files</a> in the Cloud foundry developer docs.</p>

      <p>If your still need more space contact support to talk about increasing your quota above the free tier.</p>
