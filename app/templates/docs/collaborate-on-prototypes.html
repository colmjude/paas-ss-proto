      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Work on a prototype with colleagues</h1>

      <p class="lede">This guide explains how to add a colleague to a prototype as well as explaining how to add a colleague to a subset of your prototypes.</p>


      <h2 id="add-to-proto" class="heading-medium">1. Add a colleague to your prototype</h2>

      <p>You can give any colleague with a PaaS account access to a prototype you've published on the Paas.</p>

      <p>All prototypes or apps sit within what the PaaS calls a space. Unless you have created additional spaces you have probably been working in your Sandbox space. To give access to a prototype you are actually granting access to a space, which can contain a number of prototypes.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Grant access to a colleague</h3>

      <p>Grant access by running this command:</p>

      <pre><code>cf set-space-role [USERNAME] [ORGNAME] [SPACENAME] [ROLE]</code></pre>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>cf set-space-role</code> is the CF command used to perform the action.</li>
          <li><code>[USERNAME]</code> should be the email address your colleague uses for PaaS.</li>
          <li><code>[ORGNAME]</code> is the PaaS organisation you belong to. Running <code>cf apps</code> will display your org in the first line of the commandline output.</li>
          <li><code>[SPACENAME]</code> is the space a prototype belongs to. Again, running <code>cf apps</code> will help you determine the space name to use.</li>
          <li><code>[ROLE]</code> is the permission level. It can be either <code>SpaceDeveloper</code> or <code>SpaceManager</code>. Space managers have the permissions to grant other people access to the space.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>This is an example command:</p>

      <pre><code>cf set-space-role Jane@example.gov.uk paas-disc sandbox SpaceDeveloper</code></pre>

      <p>This will grant Jane access to the sandbox space in the csd-sso organisation. She will have space developer level permissions.</p>

      <h2 id="add-to-multi-protos" class="heading-medium">2. Add a colleague to multiple prototypes</h2>
      <p>In PaaS you can group a set of prototypes into a Space. Then grant a colleague access to the space. This will give them access to all the contained prototypes at once.</p>

      <p>To see what spaces you currently have run this:</p>

      <pre><code>cf spaces</code></pre>

      <p>Unless you or anyone else in your team has created new ones you will probably see only one, Sandbox, listed.</p>

      <p>Let's look at how to create a new space, add some prototypes and then share with a colleague.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Create a new space</h3>

      <p>Create a new space with this command:</p>
      <pre><code>cf create-space [SPACENAME] -o [ORGNAME]</code></pre>

      <p>Where <code>[SPACENAME]</code> is what you'd like to call your space. For example, research-protos. <code>[ORGNAME] is the name of the organisation you belong to.</code></p>

      <p>An example command would be:</p>

      <pre><code>cf create-space research-protos -o paas-disc</code></pre>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Target space</h3>

      <p>Once created you need to tell Cloud Foundry you want to work in that space. You do that by targeting it.</p>

      <p>To target a space run:</p>

      <pre><code>cf target -s [SPACENAME]</code></pre>
      
      <p>Eg</p>

      <pre><code>cf target -s research-protos</code></pre>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Add prototypes</h3>

      <p>To add prototypes go to home directory for each prototype and run the <code>cf push</code> command.</p>

      <p>If you get stuck look at the <a href="/docs/publishing-on-paas">Publish to PaaS instructions</a>.</p>

      <p>Once you've published a few prototypes to the space move on to the next step.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Grant access to a colleague</h3>

      <p>The final step is to grant access to your colleague. We do this in the same way explained in section one of this page.</p>

      <p>In that section we had:</p>

      <pre><code>cf set-space-role Jane@example.gov.uk paas-disc sandbox SpaceDeveloper</code></pre>

      <p>Replace <code>sandbox</code> with the name of the new space you wish to grant someone access to. In our case the command would become:</p>

      <pre><code>cf set-space-role Jane@example.gov.uk paas-disc research-protos SpaceDeveloper</code></pre>

      <p>Your colleague should now have access to all the prototypes in that space.</p>
