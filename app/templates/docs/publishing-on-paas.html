      <h1 id="publishing-on-the-web-paas" class="heading-large">Publishing on the web (GOV.UK PaaS)</h1>

      <p>We recommend using <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK PaaS</a> to get your prototype online. It’s simple and fast to deploy new versions as you work.</p>
      <p>Once your prototype is on PaaS, other people will be able to access and try your prototype from their own computers or mobile devices.</p>

      <p class="panel">
        <strong>DO NOT</strong> enter real user data in to prototypes hosted on PaaS. If your prototype stores or collects user data, talk to a security professional about appropriate security steps you must take.
      </p>

      <p>A prototype deployed on PaaS is called an <code>app</code> - it will have a url like:
      <code>your-prototype.cloudapps.digital</code>.
      </p>
      <p>You can have multiple apps running on PaaS - projects often have several so they can try different ideas out at once.</p>

        <h2 id="1-sign-up-for-account" class="heading-medium">1) Sign up for an account</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/support.html">Request an account</a> and your password will be sent to you within one working day - usually much less.</p>
        <p>You'll need to be able to log in to your account each time you want to publish a new version of a prototype.</p>

        <h2 id="2-install-cloud-foundry-cli" class="heading-medium">2) Install the Cloud Foundry CLI</h2>
        <p>PaaS for government is built on top Cloud Foundry and you interact with it via the terminal/commandline.</p>
        <p>Before we can do that we need to install a CLI that will allow us to do this. <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads">Get the installer</a> from the Cloud foundry github page and run it.</p>

        <p>Check that it has installed correctly by typing</p>
        <pre><code>cf -v</code></pre>

        <p>You should get a messages like this, confirming the installed version:</p>
        <pre><code>cf version X.X.X…</code></pre>

        <p>For more information check the<a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#quick-setup-guide ">PaaS setup docs</a>, or those of your provider.</p>

        <h2 id="3-login-to-cloud-foundry" class="heading-medium">3) Login to Cloud Foundry</h2>

        <p>Log in on the commandline by typing this</p>

        <pre><code>cf login -a api.cloud.service.gov.uk -u USERNAME</code></pre>

        <p>Where <span class="bold">USERNAME</span> is the email address your account was created with.</p>

        <p>You’ll then be prompted to enter your password.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p>If you need to change your password you can do so with this command. After entering it you'll be prompted to enter a new password that follows <a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#choosing-passwords">the PaaS guidelines</a></p>
          <pre><code>cf passwd</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2 id="4-choose-name-for-prototype" class="heading-medium">4) Choose name for prototype</h2>

        <p>You need to choose a name for your app that's unique. This name will be used in the url for your prototype.</p>

        <p>For example: <code>govuk-payments-prototype</code> will create an app at: <code>govuk-payments-prototype.cloudapps.digital</code></p>
        
        <p><a href="">Find out more about how things are organised in the PaaS</a></p>

        <h2 id="5-push-your-app" class="heading-medium">5) Push your app</h2>

        <p>For each prototype you want to put on the web you need to create what Cloud foundry calls an app.</p>

        <p>In the folder where you've been working on your prototype, run:</p>

        <pre><code>cf push [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP]</code></pre>

        <p>Replace [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP] with the name of your prototype.</p>

        <p>The GOVUK prototyping kit will normally take about 3-5 minutes to deploy, other kits may take longer. If you encounter any issues please contact the GOV.UK PaaS support team if there are problems - we want to make this easy for you!</p>

        <p>Once finished you should be provided with a URL for you prototype.</p>

        <h2 id="6-set-username-and-password" class="heading-medium">6) Set a username and password</h2>

        <p>To set up credentials to protect your prototype enter the following commands on the terminal.</p>

        <p>For the username</p>
        <pre><code>cf set-env [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP] USERNAME [username_here]</code></pre>

        <p>For the password</p>
        <pre><code>cf set-env [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP] PASSWORD [password_here]</code></pre>

        <p>You need to restart your prototype for these changes to take effect</p>
        <pre><code>cf restart [NAME_OF_YOUR_APP]</code></pre>

        <h2 id="7-view-prototype-on-web" class="heading-large">7) View your prototype on the web</h2>

        <p>After your work is deployed, you will be able to view it on the web by visiting <code>https://[NAME_OF_YOUR_APP].cloudapps.digital</code>.</p>

        <p>If you are not sure what that is, or have forgotten what you called your app, you can find out all your deployed apps and their URLs by typing:</p>
        <pre><code>cf apps</code></pre>
